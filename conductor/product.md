# Product Guide: ThoughtsManager

## Vision
ThoughtsManager is a web-based, graph-focused thought mapping application designed to facilitate spatial thinking and visual cognition. It allows users to build an interactive, exploreable network of knowledge, emphasizing visual and spatial design over linear note-taking.

## Target Audience
- **Personal knowledge workers:** Individual researchers, students, and writers who manage 100-1,000 nodes and prioritize spatial organization.

## Core Goals
- **Improved memory retention:** Leveraging visual associations to help users remember and internalize information.
- **Identification of non-obvious connections:** Uncovering insights between disparate ideas through the graph structure and AI discovery.

## Key Features
- **Spatial-First Design:** An infinite canvas with hybrid auto-layout for immersive spatial organization (grouping nodes in zones/clusters).
- **Interactive Graph View:** Fluid interaction for dragging nodes, zooming, and panning to explore the knowledge network.
- **Semantic Discovery:** Integration with local LLMs (like Ollama) for semantic search and automated connection suggestions.
- **Atomic & Enriched Content:** Support for atomic text snippets, markdown files, enriched text, and web links.
- **Privacy & Portability:** Local-first design using IndexedDB with JSON export/import for complete data ownership.

## Success Metrics
- User ability to identify new patterns in their own data.
- Fluidity and performance of the graph visualization with hundreds of nodes.
