# Plan: Knowledge Synthesis & AI Partnering

This plan outlines the steps to implement advanced AI synthesis features using local LLMs.

## Phase 1: Relationship Explainer [checkpoint: 4a15f40]
- [x] Task: Implement Feature: "Explain Connection" logic that prompts Ollama with two node contents.
- [x] Task: Implement Feature: UI to select two nodes and display the AI-generated relationship explanation.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Relationship Explainer' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Cluster Summarization
- [x] Task: Implement Feature: Multi-select summarization logic.
- [x] Task: Implement Feature: UI to trigger summarization on selected nodes and display a floating summary card.
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Cluster Summarization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Thought Expansion & Graph Q&A (RAG)
- [ ] Task: Implement Feature: "Continue Thought" suggestion button in the node editor.
- [ ] Task: Implement Feature: Global AI Chat interface using RAG (Vector Search + LLM).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Thought Expansion & Graph Q&A' (Protocol in workflow.md)
