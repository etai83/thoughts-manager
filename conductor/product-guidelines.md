# Product Guidelines: ThoughtsManager

## Tone & Personality
- **Minimalist & Zen:** The application should feel calm, spacious, and focused. The interface exists to support the user's thoughts, not to compete with them. Messaging should be concise and helpful.

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Material Design / Flat:** Utilize clean lines, intentional whitespace, and a subtle color palette. Node and edge styles should prioritize clarity and readability on an infinite canvas.

## Interaction Principles
- **Mouse-Driven / Fluid:** Prioritize high-precision interactions for the graph. Dragging, zooming, and panning should feel frictionless and instantaneous (aiming for 60fps) to maintain a "flow state" during spatial exploration.

## AI Integration Experience
- **On-Demand Explorer:** AI discovery (via Ollama) should be user-triggered. The AI acts as a consultant that the user calls upon to find semantic connections, ensuring the user remains in total control of their knowledge map.

## Performance Standards
- **Instantaneous Feedback:** Every interaction with a node or the canvas must provide immediate visual feedback. UI responsiveness is critical for spatial cognition.
